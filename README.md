# Bing Wallpaper Web Browser

Browse the stored wallpapers crawled from [Bing home page](https://cn.bing.com/?ensearch=1&FORM=BEHPTB).

The wallpapers are stored in OSS. A [spider](https://github.com/cosmozhang1995/bing-wallpaper/tree/master) is used to crawl the wallpapers everyday.

This repo is deployed as GitHub pages, people can [visit the page](http://www.cosmozhang.com/bing-wallpaper/).

For now I am using my own [Aliyun OSS]() to host the files. An access key pair with read-only priviliges has been published here. I'm glad to share my wallpapers with everyone. But please remember this:

> DO NOT use this public site to run any programmatic tasks! (e.g. crawling the wallpapers). If you do that, I will receive an unaffordable bill!
